  //Permissions structure. This is simple a key for a parent permission and
  //a value (either string or array) representing children permission(s)

  //"user" has children "canReadPost" and "canListPosts". A user can read
  //posts and list posts
  "user": [
    "canReadPosts",
    "canListPosts"
  ],

  //"editor" has children "canEditPosts" and "canDeletePosts" and "user".
  //An editor can edit and delete posts as well as do anything a user can.
  //(In this can read and list posts)
  "editor": [
    "user",
    "canEditPosts",
    "canDeletePosts"
  ],

  //"admin" is the parent of "editor" with the extra permission "manageUsers"
  "admin": [
    "manageUsers",
    "editor"
  ],

  //"superadmin" is an alias for admin since they essentially have the exact
  //same permissions
  "superadmin": "admin",

  //"reportViewer" is a separate permission with no direct relationship to
  //the other permissions
  "reportViewer": [
    "canReadReports",
    "canListReports"
  ],

  //Assigning permissions to users.
  //Based on the above hierarchy we can assign permissions to given user ids

  //userid "1" is an "admin" and a "reportViewer"
  "1": ["admin", "reportViewer"],

  //userid "2" is an "editor"
  "2": "admin",

  //userid "3" is a "user"
  "3": "user"
